# Purpose

This is a sample setup to try to debug the PDF and SR display issues in OHIF v3.

This setup contains an OHIF v2 that displays PDF and SR correctly while the same files can not be displayed
on OHIF v3.

Once someone can adapt this setup to make v3 displays PDF and SR, we may try to modify the OHIF Orthanc plugin.

# Starting the setup

To start the setup, type: `docker-compose up`

# demo

- upload a sample PDF and SR in Orthanc on http://localhost:8042
- open OHIF v2 on http://localhost:3002
- open OHIF v3 on http://localhost:3003
